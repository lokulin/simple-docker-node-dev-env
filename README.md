# Node dev workspace

Requires docker or boot-to-docker

To get started just run:

```
./dev/setup_docker.sh
```

This will set up a simple node dev environment including grunt-cli and bower with a shared workspace with the host.

Just prefix your usual dev comannds with ```./dev/run.sh```, e.g.:

```
./dev/run.sh npm install grunt --save-dev
```
